### Task nr. 1 "Hangman"
Hangman is the game, in which computer chooses random word form given list, but returning it covered.
In this case its Pokemon's because I'm a fan of them. Your task is to guess the word, You can start by guessing each letter over and over.
If the word that computer choosed contains the letter, It will reveal her. Each time u guessed the letter (wrong or right) You can choose to guess the whole word. If You guessed correctly You won the game. Otherwise you lost your chance byut dont worry you have 7 of them.

###In this Game I'm mostly using:

- While loops
- If ... else
- for loops
- functions
- lists

There is a lot to improve so stay tuned to updates of this project :-)
